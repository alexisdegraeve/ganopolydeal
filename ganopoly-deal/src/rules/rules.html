    <h3><span class="nb">1.</span> DRAW 2 CARDS</h3>
    <p>Draw 2 cards from the deck and add them to your hand. If at the end of your turn you have no cards in your hand, you must draw 5 cards from the deck.</p>

    <h3><span class="nb">2.</span> PLAY UP TO 3 CARDS</h3>
    <p>You can play up to 3 cards from your hand onto the table in front of you. You are not obliged to play any card if you do not want to. There are 3 types of actions: A, B, and C.</p>
    <div class="types">
        <h4><span class="circle-red">A</span> TYPE A: PLAY "MONEY" CARDS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>During the game, you will receive rent, birthday gifts, etc.</li>
            <li>Create a "bank" pile in front of you with this money. You can put both "money" and/or "action" cards in this pile.</li>
            <li>If you put an "action" card in your bank, it automatically becomes a "money" card and can no longer be used as an action for the rest of the game.</li>
            <li>If you use it to pay another player, the card goes into their bank to be used as money, not into their hand as an action card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span class="circle-red">B</span> TYPE B: PLAY "PROPERTY" CARDS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember: To win, you must own 3 full property sets of different colors!</li>
            <li>Place your property cards face-up in front of you to build your color sets.</li>
            <li>Each card shows how many properties belong to that color set (2, 3, or 4).</li>
            <li>You can start as many color sets as you want, but you still need 3 full sets of 3 different colors to win.</li>
            <li>You can only win on your turn. If you complete 3 full sets during another player's turn, you must wait until your next turn to declare victory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span class="circle-red">C</span> TYPE C: PLAY "ACTION" CARDS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow the instructions on the action cards carefully!</li>
            <li>Action cards allow you to collect rent, steal cards, or even force other players to give you money for your birthday.</li>
            <li>If you draw an action card during your turn, you can play it immediately or keep it for later.</li>
            <li>You can also use action cards as money. The value is shown in the red circle on the card.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>HOW TO PAY DEBTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cards can never be moved into another player’s hand during a transaction.</li>
        <li>You can never pay with cards in your hand. Only cards placed on the table in front of you can be used to pay debts.</li>
        <li>You can pay with money cards from your bank, property cards, or a combination of both. You decide how to pay.</li>
        <li>Change is never given! For example, if a player requests 2M rent and you only have a 3M card in your bank, you must give the full 3M without expecting change.</li>
        <li>If you pay with property cards, the receiving player places them in their property area on the table.</li>
        <li>If you have no cards in front of you to pay, you pay nothing!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="nb">3.</span> END OF YOUR TURN</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You must not have more than 7 cards in your hand at the end of your turn (excluding cards on the table). If you have more than 7, return the extra cards to the bottom of the deck.</li>
        <li>If you have no cards in your hand at the end of your turn, draw 5 cards at the beginning of your next turn.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
